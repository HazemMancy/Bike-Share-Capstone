# Cyclistic Data Analysis Project - Full Report

> ## Overview

This report is a part of the [“Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate’s”](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics) capstone project offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/). In this report, the chosen case study is the first problem in track#1, also known as ‘Cyclistic,’ an imaginary bike-sharing company in Chicago. The company offers both traditional and assistive bikes to both casual riders and riders who are annual members.

> ## Scenario

“You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations”.

> ## Business Task

The questions that the stakeholders want answer in this scenario are: 

* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?   

* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?   

* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?   

From these questions, the priority-1 task in this project is to identify the differences of bike 
usage between annual members and casual riders. Then, use those differences to figure out 
how to keep the existing and attract new annual members to maximize Cyclistic’s profit.
